Once you have launched the game, just click or tap on the cards to flip
them over. When two cards are open the game will either lock them if their symbols match, or flip them back to closed position if it is
a mismatch. You can reset the game by hitting the `â†»` button above the deck.

### Rating

The game will also count the moves you make (2 flips = 1 move) and assign a star rating based on this number.
There is also a timer but it does not affect the actual score.
